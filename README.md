# PythonBibleProject_CinemaSimulator

This is the fifth project from the course The Python Bible containing data structures and conditionals etc.

# Goal:
The project consists of a simple cinema booking center simulation where we can buy tickets based on the number of seats available and also, based on our age, if we are allowed to watch a movie of a particular rating.
